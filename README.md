Backbone
========

Basic data structures and algorithms I need to get along and feel comfortable.


Requirements
============

For generating a single header:

1. Python 3.5 or higher


For the tests:

1. Visual Studio 2015 or higher
2. Windows 10 SDK version `10.0.10586.0` or higher. Older versions might work but are not officially supported.


Build
=====

Run `EnvSetup.bat` and then `Build.bat`.


Generate Single Header
======================

You can generate a single header (and source file, sorry!) from the Backbone source. Just run the `GenerateSingleHeader.bat` script from the repo root and optionally supply an output path.


TBD
===

Full inline-single-header (only 1 .hpp file), static library, and dll support.
